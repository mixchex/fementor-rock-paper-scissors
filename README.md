## Overview
I decided to try out this advanced challenge and showcase my front-end development skills. I included the bonus option of playing Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock as an option and the game also remembers your score by using the localStorage API.
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the game depending on their device's screen size
- Play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer
- Maintain the state of the score after refreshing the browser _(optional)_
- **Bonus**: Play Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock against the computer _(optional)_

## My process
I decided to focus on React JS as the JavaScript framework to further develop my skills as well as use Tailwind CSS which I enjoy using and developing with. I wanted to also include localStorage after using it recently.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Animations
- localStorage API
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](<https://tailwindcss.com/>) - CSS framework

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned
Overall I did not learn much from this build other than further understanding the flexibiltiy of the Tailwind CSS framework where specifically I liked finding how radial gradients can be added to the config file for a gradient other than a linear one.
